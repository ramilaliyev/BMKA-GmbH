                        <h5>Access data and hosting</h5>
                        <p>You can visit our website without providing any information about yourself. Each time a website is called up, the web server only automatically saves a so-called server log file, which is e.g. contains the name of the requested file, your IP address, the date and time of the request, the amount of data transferred and the requesting provider (access data) and documents the request.
                            This access data is evaluated exclusively for the purpose of ensuring trouble-free operation of the site and improving our offer. According to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. f GDPR to safeguard our predominantly legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer. All access data will be deleted no later than seven days after the end of your visit to the website.
                            Third party hosting services
                            As part of processing on our behalf, a third party provider provides us with the hosting and presentation of the website. This serves to safeguard our predominantly legitimate interests in a correct presentation of our offer in the context of a weighing of interests. All data that is collected as part of the use of this website or in the forms provided in the online shop as described below are processed on its servers. Processing on other servers only takes place within the framework explained here.

                        <h5>Data collection and use for contract processing</h5>
                        <p>We collect personal data if you provide it to us as part of your order or when you contact us (e.g. using the contact form or email). Mandatory fields are marked as such, because in these cases we need the data to process the contract or to process your contact and you cannot complete the order or send the contact without specifying them. Which data is collected can be seen from the respective input forms. We use the data you provide in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b GDPR for contract processing and processing your inquiries. After the contract has been fully processed, your data will be restricted for further processing and deleted after the expiry of any tax and commercial retention periods, unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data or we reserve the right to use data beyond this, which is legally permitted and about which we inform you in this declaration.</p>

                        <p>To fulfill the contract according to Art. 6 Para. 1 S. 1 lit. b GDPR, we pass on your data to the shipping company commissioned with the delivery, insofar as this is necessary for the delivery of the goods ordered. Depending on which payment service provider you select in the ordering process, we pass on the payment data collected for this purpose to the credit institution commissioned with the payment and, if applicable, to the payment service provider commissioned by us or to the selected payment service. In some cases, the selected payment service providers also collect this data themselves if you create an account there. In this case, you must log in to the payment service provider with your access data during the ordering process. The data protection declaration of the respective payment service provider applies in this respect.</p>
